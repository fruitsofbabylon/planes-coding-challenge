# Stunt Doubles Picker App with React

## About

"Tinder-swipe" card UI App allowing movie directors to chose the right double stunt among various options provided on cards. UI includes the logo of the movie, the stunt double role header and a stack of cards with photo and name of the double displayed. Cards can be swiped (drag and dropped) right (chosing the stunt) or left (not chosing the stunt). After all options are displayed and swiped the table with names of stunts and desicion results (yes/no) is showed to the user.

## Build With

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Ideas for future development

* Fix for the use on Mozilla Firefox browser (draggable global attribute).
* Add animation (card clearing) on releasing of the drag.
* Apply functional to use checked/cancel icons as buttons. When needed button is clicked the animation moves the card rigth/left updating data layer with user's choice.
* Add more interactivity to the elements (example: chosen card is highlighted on mouse drag and the opacity of the card stack is reduced).
* Create multiple tabs for diffenet movies and different stunt positions. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
